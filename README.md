Build with basic html css.

Before starting, please take into consideration the following points: 

- This test is strictly confidential, so please don't share it with anyone else. 
- The HTML/CSS should be mobile responsive
- All the assets that you need are already in Figma, you can download them from Figma file directly.
- You may see there are 2 tabs in the file, one will show you the result of the full look and feel of the page in desktop and mobile version, the second tab will give you all the component and CTA state that you need to know.
- This case is based on a real agency website that we developed previously. We already finished this project and successfully delivered it.
- The work that you will deliver is for test purposes only. We will never use it as a client's delivery. 
- Please do it as if it's a real project that you need to deliver, you can reach us with your questions once and we will answer to all your questions at the same time. 
- You will need a Figma account

I let you share your result by thursday evening.

Regarding the delivery method it's up to you, although GitHub is preferred.

Good luck and feel free to ask all your questions today.
